## 📌 Project Overview

Medical insurance cost prediction is crucial for insurance companies to assess risk and set premiums. This project uses a regression model to estimate insurance charges based on key demographic and health-related variables.

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

    Python 
    Jupyter Notebook 
    Pandas & NumPy for data preprocessing
    Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization
    Scikit-learn for regression modeling

 ## 📊 Dataset

The dataset contains features such as:

    age – Age of the insured
    bmi – Body Mass Index
    children – Number of children
    smoker – Whether the person smokes (yes/no)
    region – Location of the insured
    charges – Medical insurance cost (target variable)

## 🚀 Model Training & Evaluation

    Preprocessing: Data cleaning, feature encoding, and scaling.
    Model Used: Multiple Linear Regression.
    Evaluation Metrics:
        R² Score
        Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
        Mean Squared Error (MSE)        

## 📈 Results & Insights

    Smoking significantly increases insurance costs.
    BMI and age have a moderate impact on cost.
    The model achieves an R² score of X.XX (update with actual score).
